Welcome to my GitHub!

Here you will find some of the projects I completed during my studies at 42 Paris.

Each project includes a README explaining the objective to be achieved, the technical constraints imposed by the subject, and the final grade (along with feedback from my reviewers).

For those who may not be familiar with the 42 teaching methodology, here are a few key points before going any further:

  - The school is open 24/7.

  - There are no teachers and no traditional lectures.

  - Each student is responsible for finding solutions to their own problems.

  - Can’t find the answer? Ask the neighbor on your left — or the one on your right.

Enjoy your visit!
